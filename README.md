## Research Experience
# Computer Science Research Internship (UROP)

May 2023 - Present

Indiana University - Indianapolis

‚óè Analyzed scholarly articles to develop a framework for visual metaphor understanding
and fine-tuned AI models for metaphor-related question answering, resulting in
enhanced model performance and accuracy with some NLP metrics increasing by as
much as 100% compared to pre-fine-tuning.

‚óè Creating a dataset of challenging multiple-choice questions to test LLMs' understanding
of metaphorical concepts, utilizing tools such as Pandas, NLTK, and BERT, with partial
dataset completion and ongoing development.

# Physics Research Internship

June 2022 - July 2022

Indiana University - Indianapolis

‚óè Modeled 1D and 2D Ising Models in Python using NumPy to discover properties of
Ferromagnetic materials.

‚óè Graphed energy, magnetism, and 1D and 2D spin states using matplotlib and NumPy to
observe changes in material.

‚óè Presented findings to electrical engineering and physics faculty, industry professionals,
and to the public.

## Personal Projects

# Reddit Cat Breed Commenter

May 2024

‚óè Implemented a bot to enhance user engagement by predicting cat breeds from
user-submitted images on Reddit.

‚óè Utilized OpenAI's CLIP model fine-tuned on a custom dataset, splitting the test set to
create a validation set, and developed Python scripts to automate image retrieval and
commenting.

‚óè Successfully deployed the bot, increasing interaction on cat-related Reddit posts and
demonstrating high prediction accuracy in real-world scenarios.

# Logistic Regression Classifier

October 2023

‚óè Conducted thorough preprocessing and cleaning of the IRIS dataset to ensure data
quality and relevance for the classification task.

‚óè Utilized Scikit-learn and NumPy libraries to implement and optimize the logistic
regression algorithm.

## Volunteer Work

# Paws Pantry

August 2023 - Present

‚óè Dedicating two hours weekly to support the local food pantry, focusing on a
customer-facing role.
